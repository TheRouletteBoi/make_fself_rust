### In the `resources/` directory you will find the following files

```
resources/
├── make_fself-311.py      -> a python 3.11 version of the script
├── make_fself-27.py       -> a python 2.7 version of the script
├── gta-5.prx              -> expected input file
└── gta-5.sprx             -> expected output file, and here is the sha256 hash of the file so I can compare `8b506ee20c9d0310f476e4e614ce571d1f8438d78199a8a01a8c4d634982ae0d`
